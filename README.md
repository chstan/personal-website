# Personal website

Some quick history. The original version of this website consisted of a minimal web framework (basically just routing and templating and some middleware) I wrote in Haskell. I wanted to support more dynamic views after a time, so I migrated to this repo and used (clj, cljs) for (backend, frontend) respectively.

I still use clj for the backend, but I couldn't keep up to date enough on cljs practices (and quirks of the compilers) to justify continuing to use cljs. Around 2018 I migrated the frontend to React, where it lives now in ./front.
