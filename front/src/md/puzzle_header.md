# Slide Puzzles

This one is another piece of code written on a too-long Caltrain ride. I hope to get around to documenting it more in the future, but the short story is that we have a puzzle at work consisting of entangled plastic pieces you must slide and rotate in order to untangle. I was curious how difficult the puzzle would be to model and solve, which is what the code does below, except for the (rather interesting) case of rotating pieces.
