## Chess

I don't play much chess anymore, nor was I ever very good. 
I found the game interesting though and at one point built a 
[chess engine in C](https://github.com/chstan/chess-engine).


The project was as much an exercise in better understanding 
systems programming as it was about chess, and allowed for some
interesting followup mini-projects to script tournaments,
use simple ML algorithms to tune evaluation function parameters,
and to integrate it with my website.


You can play against it [here](http://historical.conradstansbury.com/chess) 
if you like.
